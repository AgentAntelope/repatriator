This software allows remote users to control a Repatriator aparatus, which
contains Silverpak motors, and a Canon camera.

This software exists in two distinct parts, the server and the client.


server:

The server must run in Windows and communicates with Silverpak motors and a
Canon camera.


client:

The client runs in the .NET framework and uses network communication to interact
with the server.
