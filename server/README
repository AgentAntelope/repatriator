Installation:

    install python 3.1 32-bit to C:\Python31 or somewhere else.
    install pywin32-214.win32-py3.1.exe.
        copy C:\Python31\Lib\site-packages\pywin32_system32\pywintypes31.dll
            to C:\Windows\System32\
    extract "EDSDK 2.7 Windows.zip"\EDSDK\Dll\*.dll
        to C:\Windows\System32\
    install pyedsdk and its dependencies
    install pysilverpak and its dependencies
    install imagemagick and put convert.exe in PATH
    install pypowerusb
        copy PwrUSBDll.dll to C:\Windows\System32\

Configuration:

    config.py file in the same folder as server.py:

    # address to bind the server to
    HOST = '127.0.0.1'
    # port to bind the server to
    PORT = 9999

    Try omitting this file first, and then use it if you need to.
    
Running:
    
    ./run_server.bat or ./run_server.sh to run the server forever.

How the server handles authentication:
    
    Auth data is represented as a dictionary:
        
        {
            'username': {
                'salt': '32 character random character string',
                'password_hash': sha256(salt + password),
                'privileges': set([one or more values from the privilege enum]),
            },
            ...
        }

    When it changes, it is converted to json and dumped to config.json. This file
    is parsed upon server load. There is a default admin account:

        user: default_admin
        pass: temp1234


How to communicate with the server:

    1.  Connect.

    2.  Send a MagicalRequest.

    3.  Get a MagicalResponse.

    4.  Send a ConnectionRequest with valid login information. If you want to
        operate the repatriator hardware, make sure you say so in this message.

    5.  Get back a ConnectionResult. If the status is ConnectionResult.Success,
        check the permissions you are granted. If they include
        Privilege.OperateHardware and you requested use of the hardware, the
        server will turn on the power strip, activate the camera, all the
        motors, and any attached lights.

        This setup takes some time, so it will be a few seconds before you see
        live view frames. It should theoretically be a constant amount of time,
        so you should be able to set up a progress bar based on time.

    6.  If you have privileges and requested hardware usage, the server will
        begin sending you FullUpdate messages with live view and current
        hardware position.

        At any time you may send TakePicture, DirectoryListingRequest, and
        FileDownloadRequest messages. When you TakePicture, the FullUpdate 
        frames will stop until the picture taking is complete. The picture
        will be saved and you can get it via DirectoryListingRequest and
        FileDownloadRequest.

        If you have privileges for admin, you may begin sending admin messages
        at this point. No messages are sent back regardless of whether the
        action was sucessful or not.

    7.  Disconnect when done. The server will move the motors back to the zero
        position and then turn off the power strip, killing power to the camera,
        motors, and lights.

        However, you can close the client after disconnecting and not worry
        about this.
